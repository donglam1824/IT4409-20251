            <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All this left scars on me."</li>
                <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margaret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school to study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistant plants.</li>
                <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enlist in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asks his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from DuPont, leaves behind a promising career with the chemical industry to join the Rockefeller Foundation's wheat breeding program in Mexico.</li>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Moves to Mexico and begins work on breeding a new variety of wheat that is high-yielding and disease-resistant.</li>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling Mexican breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to India and Pakistan. Despite a lack of interest from the locals, he persu
                ades the governments to allow him to set up large-scale experiments. The new wheat strains are a huge success, and a crop failure famine is averted.</li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
                <li><strong>2005</strong> - States "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are essential to feed the world's growing population.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
            </ul>
